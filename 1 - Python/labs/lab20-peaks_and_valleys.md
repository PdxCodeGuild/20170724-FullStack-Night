# Lab: Peaks and Valleys

Define the following functions:

1. `peaks` - Returns the indices of peaks. A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.

1. `valleys` - Returns the indices of 'valleys'. A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.

1. `peaks_and_valleys` - uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys in order of appearance in the original data.
