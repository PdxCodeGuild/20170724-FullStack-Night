Let's play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.

## Concepts Covered

- input, print
- if, elif, and, ==

## Instructions

1. The computer will ask the user for their choice (rock, paper, scissors)
2. The computer will randomly choose rock, paper or scissors
3. Determine who won and tell the user

Let's list all the cases:
- rock vs rock (tie)
- rock vs paper
- rock vs scissors
- paper vs rock
- paper vs paper
- paper vs scissors
- scissors vs rock
- scissors vs paper
- scissors vs scissors

Write the tie case first (when the user choice and computer choice are equal), you can eliminate 3 of the cases with 1 if-statement.
