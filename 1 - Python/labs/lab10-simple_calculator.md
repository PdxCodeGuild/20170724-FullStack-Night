# Lab 10: Simple Calculator

Write a program that asks the user for an operator and each operand. Don't forget that `input` returns a `string`, which you can convert to a float using `float(user_input)` where `user_input` is the string you got from `input`. Below is some sample input/output.


```
> What is the operation you'd like to perform? +
> What is the first number? 5
> What is the second number? 12
> 5 + 12 = 17
```


## Version 2

Allow the user to keep performing operations until they say 'done'.
Use `while True` and `break`. Below is some sample input/output.

```
> what is the operation you'd like to perform? +
> what is the first number? 5
> what is the second number? 12
> 5 + 12 = 17
> what is the operation you'd like to perform? done
> goodbye! 
```
