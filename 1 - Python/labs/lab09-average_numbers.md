# Lab 9: Average Numbers

We're going to average a list of numbers. Start with the following list, iterate through it, keeping a 'running sum', then divide that sum by the number of elements.

The code below hows how to loop through an array, and prints the elements one at a time.
```python
nums = [5, 0, 8, 3, 4, 1, 6]
for num in nums:
    print(num)
```

## Version 2

Ask the user to enter the numbers one at a time, putting them into a list. If the user enters 'done', then calculate and display the average. The following code demonstrates how to add an element to the end of a list.

```python
nums = []
nums.append(5)
print(nums)
```
