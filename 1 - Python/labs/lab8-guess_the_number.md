# Lab 8: Guess the Number

Let's play 'Guess the Number', the computer will guess a random int between 1 and 10. The user will then try to guess the number, and the program will tell them whether they're right or wrong.

## Version 1

Using a `while` loop, allow the user to guess 10 times. If they fail to guess the number after 10 tries, the user is told they've lost.

## Version 2

Allow the user to make an unlimited number of guesses using a `while True` and `break`. Keep track of how many guesses the user has made, and tell them at the end.

## Version 3

Tell the user whether their guess is above ('too high!') or below ('too low!') the target value.

# Version 4

Tell the user whether their current guess is closer than their last.

# Version 5

Swap the user with the computer: the user will pick a number, and the computer will guess until they get it right.
