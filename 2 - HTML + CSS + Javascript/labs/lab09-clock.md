# Lab 9: Clock


Make a clock that displays the current time and updates every second. Check out [JavaScript timing events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp) and [dates](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp). Writing `new Date()` creates a date with the current date and time. You can then create a string from that date, and set it in the DOM.

Next make a countdown timer and stopwatch. The countdown timer should alert the user when it's finished (using an `alert("TIME'S UP")` or changing the background color, etc). The stopwatch should have a feature to log a lap, as well as stop it. There should be controls on the page to switch between them (hint: `display:none` or `$('#the_div').hide() and .show()` if using jQuery).
