## What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions by giving the file to the python interpreter.




## Why Python?

- Active development, wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for game dev, web dev, data science, etc
- It'll be easy to adapt your skills to other languages

## Practical Advice


- Experimentation is essential to learning how to program. Don't be afraid to break your code. Once you understand what's going on it's not hard to re-write from scratch, and if you're nervous, you can always create a new file. Executing code gives you immediate feedback on what they code means.

- Whenever you begin a problem, spell out the exact steps you're going to take to solve it in comments. This will help you conceptualize the solution and practice thinking procedurally.

- Add lots of comments. They'll help you keep track of what's going on while you're coding, and refresh your memory if you look back at it later.

- There are many different interests which determine what's "good code" or the "proper" way to solve a problem. Becoming a good programmer means finding the intersection of these interests.

    - Technical interests: it works, and works efficiently. All the varieties of possible input, and possible paths of execution, should be covered.
    
    - Human interests: your code should be easily read and understood, which makes it more easily maintained and extended.

- If you get stuck, try to review the 'bigger picture' of what they whole program is supposed to do, look at similar examples.

- Questions help me help you.

- You can use google, and look at other people's solutions, but it's important to understand what their code is doing **in context**. Copy-pasting large sections of code rarely works, and will only make things more confusing.

- Using `print` to look at the value of variables, and using the PyCharm debugger will help you keep track of how the code is running.

- When you think you've got a solution, make sure the code runs and works, and then try a range of inputs. Carefully review what you'll get for different inputs, the possible "paths of execution" your code may follow. "Edge cases" are an extremely common source of bugs in software.
