# Text Editors and IDEs

You can use any text editor for writing source code, but some text editors have features specifically for programming. These are called IDEs: Integrated Development Environments. Below are some common features of IDEs:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Refactoring
- Testing & Debugging
- Version Control
- Deployment

The more features a program has, the more cluttered its interface will be, the longer it'll take to open and close, etc. Many people prefer using a more 'lightweight' text editor, and then executing their python in a terminal by typing `python source_file.py`.
