# Version Control with Git

How do multiple people work on a single program without 
'Version Control' . There is a code `repository` or `'repo'` on a remote server. By creating a `branch`, a developer can work and commit changes without changing the `master` copy of the code. After getting the feature in a reasonably-developed state, the developer can then `merge` the branch with master, and others can `pull` their changes from the repository.


Below are some benefits to using a VCS:

- Security: Many hours of work goes into developing software, and it is thus highly valuable to a company or organization. What if a laptop is stolen, or a hurricane floods the datacenter, or hackers wipe your harddrives?

- Collaboration: Multiple people can edit a program's source code simultaneously.

- History: By keeping track of every change, one can easily reverse a mistaken change they'd made, and always has access to a 'working version' once established.
