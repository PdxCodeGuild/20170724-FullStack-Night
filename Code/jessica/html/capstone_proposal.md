#Capstone Proposal:  Trends in Food Access and Insecurity
##Product Overview: 
To analyze food environment access and compare to health outcomes. Visualize data using D3
##Specific Functionality:
map of the United states plot by color (heat-map) % of population with low access to food. 
##Data Model:
##Technical Components:
##Schedule:
##Further Work:
1. open excel in python using pandas package
2. use pandas to calculate correlations, calculate access % change over five years, compare food insecurity over time by state
3. what kind of data it will result in (model) correlation matrix, % change in access
4. how to visualize that data using d3:
